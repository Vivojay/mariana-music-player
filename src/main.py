# Mariana Player v0.4.2

# running app:
# 	For very first boot (SETUP):
# 	  Make sure you have python version < 3.10 to run this file (unless compatible llvmlite wheel bins exist...)
# 	  Setup this program in a fresh virtualenv
# 	  Download and pip install unofficial binary for llvmlite wheel compatible with your python version
# 	  Setup compatible architecture of VLC media player, install FFMPEG and add to path...
# 	  Install git scm if not already installed
# 	  Install given git package directly from url using: `pip install git+https://github.com/Vivojay/pafy@develop`
# 	  run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
#
# 	  Firstly, look at help.md before running any py file
# 	  Run this file (main.py) on the very first bootup, nothing else (no flags, just to test bare minimum run)...
# 	  You are good to go...
#     *Note: If you encounter errors, look for online help as the current help file doesn't have common problem fixes yet
#
# 	All successive boots (RUNNING NORMALLY):
# 	  just run this file (main.py) with desired flags (discussed in help.md)
# 	  and enjoy... (and possibly debug...)

# This app may take a LOT of time to load at first... (main culprit: librosa)
# Hence the loading prompt...
# Prompts like these will be made better and more
# dynamic using the IPrint (custom) and multiprocess modules

# Editor's Note: Make sure to brew a nice coffee beforehand... :)
