# Mariana Music Player (v0.3.2)

## About
Feature rich command-line music player. \
Can play songs of [supported file types](some/path) and perform basic music control operations \
alongwith some [advanced controls and manipulations](some/other/path)

## Technical
This program uses the pygame module for playing and controlling songs stored locally.
This program also uses the vlc module for playing and controlling songs streamed from the internet.

Pygame requires you to first initialize its mixer object by calling the init function `pygame.mixer.init()`

Then you can load a song with `pygame.mixer.music.load( "path-to-file.ext" )`

Finally to play, pause, mute, unmute, set volume, queue, and stop song \
you can do it all using the `pygame.mixer.music` as follows:
- `pygame.mixer.music.play()`
- `pygame.mixer.music.pause()`
- `pygame.mixer.music.set_volume(0)`
- `pygame.mixer.music.set_volume(cached-volume-as-percentage)`
- `pygame.mixer.music.set_volume(desired-volume-as-percentage)`
- `pygame.mixer.music.queue('next_song')`



## Usage
Install PyPI modules from pip using `pip install -r requirements.txt` \
Run `main.py` from command line with desired arguments, for more details, [look here](rick/roll).
