## About This Help

EBNF metasyntax is used for syntax formatting here.  
Lines written after a \` `#` \` symbol are not of any importance, they are stale unimplemented features or future ideas.

Show commands shows files matching query in 4 columns by default.  
This can be changed in the config file.

All searches are fuzzy

**Basic syntax rules are summarized as follows:**

| Command             | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| this \| that        | Option between values              |
| optional_ie_0_or_1? | Optional value                     |
| zero_or_more\*      | Value may occur zero or more times |
| one_or_more+        | Value may occur one or more times  |

#         1> override current play-queue and start a queue instead
#         2> append new queue to current play-queue
#         3> continue playing current play-queue

Save all recursive file paths from all lib dirs in a libpaths files for quick reload 
Mark unplayable/corrupt song files and exclude them from libpaths
    Exclude the unplayable/corrupt from libpaths.yml "general" heading and shift them to "corrupt"

The shuffle command will shuffle the current play-queue
The shuffle command can shuffle the current queue or any of the other requested "named queues" (Beta)
	Syntax:

Loops will be given preference over queues and play-queues, i.e. if a song is looped from within a queue,
then it will keep looping until the loop is closed. After the loop is closed,
the remaining queued songs will start playing as usual until the queue(s) end(s).
Make it colourful. Make display tasty and colourful with borders and themes!

Reddit RPAN - Add sync feature
Reddit sessions by famous* players:
    e.g.    @jonathandaleofficial
            @saxsquatch
            ...
Connect to popular free lyrics service (shazamio)
Hide/blacklist songs
Clear recents/history logs/etc….
Set metadata:
	Artist
	Song name
    .. (Few others?)
ReplayGain support
Easy way to rename and delete files from disk
The 'now' command should show if a 'queue' is playing or a 'sequence' or a 'play-queue'

Remote playback from/to other's systems

Copy/Replace a file into a converted format

Make Externally controllable (via keyboard keys...)?


If help or config file is not available or is corrupted, prompt user to download required files from GitHub or use default
If default file is not available or is corrupted, prompt user to download required files from GitHub or close program, play beep at the end


VAS Checklist:
    [ ] Add song stop detect; raise flag on song stop when played as VAS
    [x] Radio
    [x] Play single video as audio
    [x] Video list, pick video, play as audio
    [x] Reddit Sessions

Make everything configurable, including:
    Making commands (un)available
implement rel_val: rel_val = +5 means seek +5000 ms relative to cur pos
Make a new command t*: must show: (<abs_progress\> / <total_length\>) + (percent_complete)
Show a small GUI window for constant progress display... (Requires multiprocessing??)
Allow decimal-point time seeking for VAS media type
Make seek work for pygame? or solve it automatically by entirely migrating to VLC...

Have various user logins with completely separate encrypted data which is only decrypted once 
the user successfully logs in...

Set volume at boot to: `override_default_boot_volume` or set it to remember last session's volume

Get list of urls of `n` newly released songs from whatever sources possible (any 3rd party api or one of the moajor players listed below...)
Connect with Music Streaming Services?? E.g.
    YTMusic?
    Spotify?
    Deezer?
    SoundCloud?
    Other...
    (`n` maybe adjustable via the config/commandline/fallback_value/etc...)

Make the (ls|list) feature way more powerful and robust, migrate from (f[ind]) to (ls|list)
    i.e. deprecate (f[ind])... (but not completely remove it yet...)

Give users a short note about the fact that importing modules no.: 7, 17, 22, 23, and 24
    take a longer time than usual

ACTUALLY MAKE USE OF the `loglevel` variable, it's not just for fun :meh:
    for refs: loglevels have the following values:
        {
            0: "none",  # Don't log anything, not even fatal crashes (LIKE WHUT?)
            1: "fatal", # Only log fatalities
            2: "warn",  # Log fatalities + warnings
            3: "info",  # Log fatalities + warnings + info
            4: "debug"  # Log pretty much every single line of code, this's going to take my whole day :(
        }
