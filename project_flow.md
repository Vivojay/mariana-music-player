## About This Help
EBNF metasyntax is used for syntax formatting here.  
Lines written after a \` `#` \` symbol are not of any importance, they are stale unimplemented features or future ideas.

Show commands shows files matching query in 4 columns by default.  
This can be changed in the config file.

All searches are fuzzy

**Basic syntax rules are summarized as follows:**

| Command             | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| this \| that        | Option between values              |
| optional_ie_0_or_1? | Optional value                     |
| zero_or_more*       | Value may occur zero or more times |
| one_or_more+        | Value may occur one or more times  |

### Queueing
#### Legacy Functions (play-queue)

| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| play (<n1\>+) | Play all provided songs in alp order |

E.g.

| Commands   | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| play 6 2 4 | Queue and Play (ORDER MATTERS): <br> Play songs 6, 2 and 4 in that order <br> Displays names of songs in a newly issued play-queue <br> Displays "current play-queue over" after it's over |
| clear      | Clear all songs except now-playing from the current play-queue |

```
# Note:
#     Queue inside the play functions isn't a named queue and it ISN'T saveable
#     Also, this queue will instantly be broken and lost if a queue command is issued
#     To safeguard against the accidental unwanted override of the current play-queue, you will be prompted to either:
#         1> override current play-queue and start a queue instead
#         2> append new queue to current play-queue
#         3> continue playing current play-queue
```

#### Beta Functions
Following 2 functions work same as for \`play (<n1\>+)\`  
(Queue names with spaces must be in quotes/double quotes)  

| Commands             | Description                                                  |

| q n myqname (<n1\>+) | Create a new saveable queue named \`myqname\` with all provided songs in order <br> (Repeated names will throw an error and will not be allowed) |

A new queue may start automatically when an individual song/queue ends (Can be edited in config.yml file)

| Commands                           | Description                                      |

**Note**
```
BTS, a new queue is created (marked as a \`sequence\` object to differentiate from actual \`queue\` objects, in case of name collisions).

This larger "queue" contains all other provided queues which were appended in it using appropriate commands while creation of sequence.

This larger queue is marked as a sequence and is treated as one.
```

#### Cueing
**Note**
    A kind of advanced seek pointer for songs
    This "seek" position can be taken from current position or set manually
    This "seek" position can be saved for later use
    This "seek" position can also be applied to any another song whenever you want

**Save cue object for later**
